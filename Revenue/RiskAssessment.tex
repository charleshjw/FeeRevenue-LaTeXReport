\subsection{Background}
The risk inventory is part of a broader risk identification and risk materiality
process intended to drive the identification of material risks for CCAR scenario
generation process for each business.\\

This enterprise wide risk inventory was developed leveraging the Bank's Business
As Usual risk management and Line Of Business processes. Additional risks were
also identified through review during working sessions with key business line
CROs and business partner leads.

\subsection{Objective}
The objective of the risk inventory is to aggregate the Bank's financial and
non-financial risks to financial performance in a manner that is aligned to the
Bank's aggregated risk taxonomy developed for the identification and materiality
of key risks for the firm. (Note - this preliminary risk inventory does not
represent the complete universe risks at this time).\\

This risk inventory will be used to identify the segmentation and granulaity we
want to model for each business. The end goal of this process is to perform a
materiality assessment for all identified risks, in order to identify those that
would result in a material financial and/or non-financial impact to the Bank
from a capital adequacy perspective.

\subsection{Questions for Business Team}
Assess severity and probability of bank's top 45 business risks and determine
their impact to fee revenue. Questions need to be answered are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How should we segment revenue to better reflect risks?
  \item How should we model revenue to capture the distinctive nature of
  material business risk?
  \item What data are required?
  \item	Is there any other material risk not included in top 45 risks?
  \item Based on business intuition and historical experience, which risks would
  predominantly impact the business and to what extent under each of the
  Supervisory Scenarios from the Fed and the BHC Stress Scenario?
  \item How should we calculate overlay adjustments/ management judgments to
  account for these risks? Are there other business specific risks that are not
  included in this list?
\end{itemize}

To get oriented with the next couple of pages, we have described the risks that
are considered material from a BNY Mellon perspective. To the right, we have a
materialy assesment scorecard which is stated in terms of severity rating; 1
being least severe and 5 being most.
